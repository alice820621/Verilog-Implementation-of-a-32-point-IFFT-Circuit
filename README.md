# Verilog-Implementation-of-a-32-point-IFFT-Circuit
A FIFO structure is implemented to hold input and output data. There are 32 pairs of real and imaginary inputs, consisting of 4-bit integer and 24-bit decimal values each. The 32-point IFFT has 5 layers with 32 butterflies each. The device operates with a speed of 200MHz.
